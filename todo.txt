DOES all the print functionalities actually work?? TEST

fill in more ideas for a configurations page

series and series_details: i dont think REGEN is working

gotta speedup ajax/issues!! is the problem in the ajax query, or in processing the results, or getting the images, or something?
NOT SURE -- query takes less than a second, datatable loading with 100/page takes 7+ seconds and 50/page take 4+ seconds.
the datatable ordering is injected into the query, so removing it has no effect on datatable load time.
removing the full cover-image from the ajax output has no effect on datatable load time either.
whats causing the slow load time???

START ADDING PRICES!! may just have to screen-scrape ComicPriceGuide.com, can't find any API's.  Comicster may have prices, but i'd have to import my collection to find out (i think), same with ComicBase.
TODO: just add an editable column for price and another auto-filled by date-added (easy, obvious, simple).
but what about if i change the condition? maybe store the price as NM(9.2) and then fractionalize by the actual condition? how often do i change the condition (after the initial pass)?

Grading: add VF/NM, and VG/F ???
best guide i've found for defining the grades (both classic and modern) and also defining how to examine a book
https://artfulinvestments.com/comic-book-grading/
include config toggle for which grade config to use (simple vs detailed)

i'm not sure why this is important? in addSeriesSelect, for last/first/issue columns: if(intval(ish)!=ish){errorlog(invalid ish num?)} and then sort by intval no matter what (what about "12.1"? doesnt make sense)

addIssues and issues: INCLUDE A CHECKBOX FOR 'AUTOGRAPHED' (low priority)

home: ADD DROPDOWN FOR SORTING coll/series/vol/issue/grade, series/vol/issue/grade, and ??? -- remember the value in SESSION 

User: add user-roles, include a role that can only "view" the admin functionality, for promo purposes, exclude access to the "add" pages, only show/allow the list pages

maybe not do

DB: this is interesting, but not sure if a good thing to use caches, doesn't the db sorts quicker than php?
ON ALL QUERIES THAT ALTER THE DATABASE ... 
UPDATE A NEW TABLE THAT CONTAINS ONE ROW WHICH IS THE LAST UPDATE TIME,
and then in router we can load a cache of all issues/series/collections only if the current time is after the last-update-time

router: load a cache of all issues/series/collections only if the current time is after the last-update-time (new db table w/ 1 row)
PROBABLY DO THAT AFTER A CHECKIN, SO I CAN REVERT IF ITS NOT RIGHT

addIssues: default the 'collection' option to the previous choice (not sure i can do, the collection options are determined when the page loads)
i guess i can call ajax onchange, set the session var, create the collection options again and pass them back, 
but then i'd have to figure out which are the remaining rows and only change the collection options for them (its possible)

wanted to be able to select/display variant covers, but the comicvine api for issues doesn't give the url for them
