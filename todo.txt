addIssues:

TODO: default the 'collection' option to the previous choice (not sure i can do, the collection options are determined when the page loads)
  i guess i can call ajax onchange, set the session var, create the collection options again and pass them back, 
  but then i'd have to figure out which are the remaining rows and only change the collection options for them (its possible)

maybe: INCLUDE A CHECKBOX FOR 'AUTOGRAPHED' (low priority)

//////////////////////////////////////////////
addSeriesSelect:

TODO: on the javascript seriesvolume prompt, parse the series volume from comicvine and use that as the default (instead of default=1)

//////////////////////////////////////////////
home:

maybe: ADD DROPDOWN FOR SORTING coll/series/vol/issue/grade, series/vol/issue/grade, and ??? -- remember the value in SESSION 

//////////////////////////////////////////////
series and series_details: 

TODO: i dont think REGEN is working

//////////////////////////////////////////////
DB:

TODO: this is interesting, but not sure if a good thing to use caches, doesn't the db sorts quicker than php?
TODO: ON ALL QUERIES THAT ALTER THE DATABASE ... 
UPDATE A NEW TABLE THAT CONTAINS ONE ROW WHICH IS THE LAST UPDATE TIME,
and then in router we can load a cache of all issues/series/collections only if the current time is after the last-update-time

//////////////////////////////////////////////
Grading:

TODO: maybe add VF/NM, and VG/F ???
best guide i've found for defining the grades (both classic and modern) and also defining how to examine a book

//////////////////////////////////////////////
User:

TODO: add user-roles, include a role that can only "view" the admin functionality, for promo purposes
TODO: exclude access to the "add" pages, only show/allow the list pages

//////////////////////////////////////////////
lookup:

TODO: isset(comicvine) doesnt properly prevent duplicates from being created?? may want to match by name/volume, or comicvine-full-id??!!?

TODO: create a change-log to log previous and new values of changed items, and the item name, user-id, time, maybe for every value changed?? naw, just include an array of the changed values

//////////////////////////////////////////////
router:

TODO: load a cache of all issues/series/collections only if the current time is after the last-update-time (new db table w/ 1 row)
PROBABLY DO THAT AFTER A CHECKIN, SO I CAN REVERT IF ITS NOT RIGHT
